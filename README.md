# Swing
Easier Terminal and packages for 'Arch Linux'.
# What is Swing?
Swing is a terminal that is supposed to be super easy for linux beginners. Linux can be SUPER HARD at times. With Swing, you can make everything easy. Even when developing, it's as easy as a SNAP to make and publish your app. You can code it in anything you want (as long as it's supported by linux...).
